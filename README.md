# Ride-Share Route Tracker with ETA (React & Google Maps API) #
This repository demonstrates a web application built with React.js and the Google Maps API. It simulates a ride-sharing scenario, displaying a route with markers for stops and calculating an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for the next stop.

## Features: ##

Interactive map visualization with route and stop markers
Basic ETA calculation based on pre-defined route and average speed

## Setup Instructions: ##

Clone this repository: git clone https://<your_github_username>@github.com/<your_username>/<repository_name>.git
Install dependencies: npm install
Start the development server: npm start (Opens the application in your web browser)

## Technologies Used: ##

Frontend: React.js
Mapping and Routing: Google Maps API

## Note: ##

An API key for the Google Maps API is not included in this repository. You'll need to obtain your own API key and configure the application accordingly.
Further Development:

Implementation of real-time driver location tracking.
Integrate with a backend for user interaction and data persistence.
Enhance the ETA calculation with dynamic speed adjustments.
This project serves as a foundation for exploring React development and Google Maps API integration. Feel free to explore further functionalities and customize the application to your needs.
